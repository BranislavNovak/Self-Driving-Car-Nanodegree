Overview
---

This repository contains my solutions for the projects of the Self Driving Car Nanodegree.

There are three terms in the Nanodegree, and each term contains several projects.
1. Computer Vision and Deep Learning :
   * Finding lane lines
   * LeNet implementation with Tensorflow
   * Traffic Sign Classifier
   * Behavioral Cloning
   * Advanced Lane Finding
   * Vehicle Detection and Tracking
2. Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control
3. Path Planning, Concertrations, and Systems

So far, I have completed the following projects :

### 1. Computer Vision and Deep Learning
   * Finding lane lines

      The goal is to find the lane markings, and draw two full lanes between which the car should stay.

   * Traffic Sign Classifier

      The goal of the project is classifying traffic signs using Deep Learning.
